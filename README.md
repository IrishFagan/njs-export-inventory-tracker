<h2>Newly Listed Components</h2>

<p>The main page displays the most recent listing date and the recently listed products for that date. A drop-down calendar is available to select past dates to be able to sift through recently listed products. Each product image can be selected to open a new tab to that listing on njs-export.</p>

<h2>Keyword Subscription</h2>

<p>Alongside the recently listed products is a field where users can enter in their email and comma separated keywords. Upon submitting these keywords are saved and then compared against each newly listed product on njs-export. If a newly listed products contains a keyword then the user(s) subscribed to that keyword are notified through an email.</p>
